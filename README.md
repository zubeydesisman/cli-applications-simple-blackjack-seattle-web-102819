#Blackjack

##Objective
Practice conditional logic including nested conditionals by making a command line game that plays blackjack.

##Deliverable
Create a repo on your github called blackjack.  It should include one file called blackjack.rb.

##Instructions
We are going to build a command line blackjack game.  A player gets dealt two cards which have values between 1-11.  After they get dealt two cards you should show them the total score of their cards and ask them if they want to hit or stay. A player is allowed to "hit" up to two times.  After each hit you should ask if they want to hit or stay and display the total value of their cards. If they don't want to hit, and they are not at 21 they lose.  Your program should tell them they lose and exit.

Note:  To take input from the person "playing" the game your program will have to use the Ruby method "gets".

##Challenge
After successfully completing the previous game (there should be a commit with a working version of this game), alter the game so that a player can "hit" as many times as they want.
